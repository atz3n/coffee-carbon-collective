## About:
We are participating in the Consensus Hackathon - web3athon - and will have our first prototype released on 20th September 2022. We will accumulate the learnings in a GitBook and share them with the grant supporters. Stay tuned!

## Problem:
Rising temperatures are going to reduce the area suitable for growing coffee by up to 50% by 2050.

Coffee farmers suffer from climate change affecting their farmers and recognize the urge to transition to agroforestry to protect their farms and future. You can read more about agroforestry here.

During the last months, we spoke to more than 50 farmers in Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Brazil. We also did 25 face-to-face interviews at World of Coffee (the largest coffee industry event, June 2022) and talked to 20 coffee, regenerative agriculture, and carbon project development professionals:

100% of coffee farmers suffer from climate change already now (drought, shifting seasons, pests & diseases).
93% of interviewed coffee farmers recognize the need to transition to regenerative agriculture and consider agroforestry the only viable solutions
Transition to agroforestry takes 4-5 years and requires financial and human resources. Crop volume drops short-term, and farmers need to have the security of revenues.
Right now smallholder farmers (3-5 ha) are not able to get certified to sell carbon credits (certification cost 50k and is financially feasible for 1000ha farms).
Smallholders are ready to act, but the absence of pre-financing tools and safety nets stops them from switching to regenerative agriculture and sequestering carbon at their farms already now!

##Solution:
CCC provides a web3 AI-enabled ecosystem to support coffee farmers in transitioning to agroforestry by providing tools for pre-financing and tools for direct trade with climate-conscious coffee buyers.

Farmer enrolls into agroforestry transition program with CCC, CCC quantifies future carbon savings and mints a geo-spatial NFT that keeps the track of regeneration of the farm. Farmer requests pre-financing of transition by issuing carbon credit tokens that are connected to geospatial NFTs using CCC infrastructure and fundraising directly from the climate-conscious buyers. CCC guides the farmer through transition and keeps the track of activities, verifies practices and results through dMRV. CCC provides another set of contracts for the direct coffee trade to open market access for "regenerated coffee".

We believe that there is a great opportunity to build a solution for insetting, not offsetting. There is a strong commitment of traders and roasters to reducing the carbon footprint of coffee production and a strong will to support the farmers they work with. However, like any carbon credit buyer, they need transparency and accountability. We are developing our solution on Celo and Filecoin, using a dMRV infrastructure like dMeter or MRV Collective.

## Impact:
There are 10.2 million ha of coffee land worldwide, 84% of coffee is grown under sun in mono-crop farms and only 16% on average - shade or agroforestry grown. You can read about the impact of agroforestry systems here.

Carbon sequestration potential (carbon stock) for agroforestry-grown coffee is 6.5 tons/ha in comparison to 2.6 tons/ha with conventional production. Check out more here. At the moment coffee producing areas sequester 32,508,898.50 tons of carbon, but switching to agroforestry has the potential to sequester 34,204,306.50 tons more! Check out calculations here.

Besides, switching to agroforestry will mean:

Improves farmers’ livelihood: it allows farmers to produce food, fodder, fuel, and timber from farmland - up to 20% more revenue
Reduce amounts of fertilizers: tree-rich farming systems reduce the application of nitrogen fertilizer - lower costs of production
Increase biodiversity by growing various species at the coffee farms
Improve productivity: Trees in the croplands improve productivity and create carbon sinks - growing coffee and carbon revenues
Prevent deforestation: Tropical deforestation is responsible for 25% of the net annual CO2 emissions worldwide
Improve farmers’ resilience to extreme weather, especially drought and frost

## Roadmap:
Stage 1: Prototype & Methodology (September - December 2022) - GR15 funding

Prototype of the carbon sequestration methodology - data collection from farmers and analysis, modeling resources necessary for farm transition, incl. financial, labor, and the time required for transition, calculator of pre-financing needed based on farmer’s data
Prototype onboarding UI for farmers - No-code UI for data collection, farm state visualization, carbon sequestration calculation for farmers, and NFT minting
Implement NFTs and carbon tokens - Farm-specific geospatial non-sellable NFTs with information like location, carbon info, ERC20 tokens for pre-financing of regeneration, NFTs for seasonal coffee purchasing as in the form of an agreement

We are participating in the Consensus Hackathon - web3athon - and will have our first prototype released on 20th September 2022. We will accumulate the learnings in a GitBook and share them with the grant supporters. Stay tuned!

Stage 2: Build a community & Develop dMRV (January - June 2023)

Improve our carbon sequestration prediction methodology and model various scenarios of farm regeneration based on the initial state and most optimal path to traditional polyculture
Onboard farmers in Colombia and Brazil, build an in-field support operation through existing cooperatives and freelance agronomists, and prototype and test farmer support programs and agroforestry guides. Onboard roasters and coffee carbon investors on the platform test their demand and wishes
Develop fully-functional dMRV solution for agroforestry in cooperation with the research institutions, agroforestry practitioners, and existing digital MRV solutions (eg. dMeter, MRV Collective)

Stage 3: Launch operations & Form a DAO (July - December 2023)

Launch full-scale operations in Colombia and Brazil
Form a DAO for farmers and funders

We are committed to building a solution that benefits coffee farmers and funders, as well as the entire ReFi community. The methodology we develop will be made open source and accessible to anyone who needs it. We will make our learnings from the field projects and working with funders public and accessible for other regenerators.
